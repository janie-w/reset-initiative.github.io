            <p id = "goal">Our goal: see increased STEM & STEAM engagement
                among minority youth by reaching them in the classroom during
                the school day
                </p>
            <p>By introducing underpriviledged kids to the fascinating world of
                science, engineering, and technology, we hope to show them that
                they're capable of enjoying and being successful in these
                highly employable fields and thus creating a brighter future
                both for themselves and for America.</p>
            <p>We're a nonprofit run by students, for students. Based out of
                Loudoun Academy of Science, we've been working to make a
                difference since 2014.</p>

            <h1>Science.</h1>
            <p>We're delivering experience-based learning to the elementary
                school classroom with hands-on, in-school demos and
                entertaining videos with guided experiments that are
                specifically crafted with the fifth grade brain in mind. By
                allowing students to learn by doing instead of by reading out
                of a textbook or watching a lecture, we're making science fun
                and interesting again.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "set" id = "eng">
            <h1>Engineering.</h1>
            <p>We offer an engineering competition to allow students to learn
                about and experience the cycle of trying and failing until
                finally finding a solution that is ultimately the heart of
                engineering. Students get to learn valuable skills such as
                persistance and problem solving and experience the joy of a
                hard-earned success all while engaging in healthy, fun
                competition with their peers. </p>

        <div class = "set" id = "tech">
            <h1>Technology.</h1>
            <p>To address the lack of technology education in elementary
                schools, we're giving fun coding workshops to allow students to
                get their feet wet with computer science. By introducing them
                to these topics at a young age, we hope to make coding seem
                more accessible and less intimidating. This way, they can see
                that coding is something they can do, as well as that it can be
                fun and useful. </p>
